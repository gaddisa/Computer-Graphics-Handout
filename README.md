# Computer-Graphics-Handout
 ## Computer Graphics Handout and exercise solution for begginers using OpenGL Library and C++
This repository contains Computer Graphics Lecture Note and  OPenGL C++ sample codes that I used to teachCOmputer Graphics Course at Dire Dawa University from 2015 to 2017. These samples try to help newcomers quickly find an appropriate algorithm for building 2D Video game and programming problems. Also they can quickly find out how a popular grahics Libarary "OPenGL"  is generally used to build a video game and simulation. 

These samples are by no means complete, nor free from deficiencies. Feel free to make them complete or introduce them to more graphics newbies or teachers. The samples cover only basic vide game delopment.

Thanks!
